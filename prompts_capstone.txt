based on the work done for ner and from the perspective of an academically brilliant student, create a the technical paper and fill in the contents then iteratively include all the missing items that an evaluator will be looking. go deep and reason deeply to iteratively furnish it while checking each citation for both substantiation and relevance. do so for 50 iterations or until you cannot improve it further.



I need to turn this into a segment on the NER agent I am working on in the technical paper that includes all the agents for this project. the format used should be latex generated using the batch file i am uploading now. please also reference the structure but all fashion related project information should be purged from this exercise because that was a project from the previous semester. 
yes to this: adapt your existing .bib file (purge fashion references, add only NER/CTI papers like BERT, RoBERTa, SecBERT, MITRE ATT&CK, CVE, KEV, EPSS) so your LaTeX compiles seamlessly
yes to this: reate a new CyberSage.bib with only CTI/NER references
embed these three figures with captions into your PR3 final Word document, or keep them as supplementary diagrams for the Capstone Technical Paper
yes to this: regenerate the entire PR3 Final document with embedded supplementary diagrams in one go?
yes to this: prepare similar .tex stubs for the other three agents (A: Ingest, C: Risk & Triage, D: Explainability) so you’ll have a full 4-agent technical paper skeleton ready to compile
yes to: similar .tex stubs for the other three agents (A: Ingest, C: Risk & Triage, D: Explainability) so you’ll have a full 4-agent technical paper skeleton ready to compile
yes to this: minimal buildable main.tex that stitches all four agents together with a skeleton abstract, intro, and references — ready to compile with your build_report.bat.
regenerate the cleaned CyberSage.bib as a file and package them all into a zip file.
Add the full agent content (not just stubs) for A, B, C, D to this package so the final PDF is close to camera-ready.
Insert a References sanity check (e.g., add a couple of \cite{...} lines in Agent B) to confirm BibTeX is fully wired.
do the following and regenerate capstone_report.zip for download:
Rewrote agentB_ner.tex with the full NER section including citations to:	
devlin2018bert, liu2019roberta, jehangir2023ner, recentner2024, secbert2020, securebert2021, mitre_attack, cve_reference, cisa_kev, epss_reference.
Added a safety net \nocite{*} in main.tex (right before the bibliography) so the bibliography renders even if citations are optimized away or not yet referenced.
Ensured all ampersands in section titles are escaped (e.g., \&).
Repackaged everything into a clean archive.


first outline the report structure for the following prompt: *"You are an NUS-ISS student writing an Individual Accomplishment Report for the part-time MTech in AI Systems capstone project. The project is CyberSage, a multi-agent cyber threat intelligence platform. My contribution was the NER Agent. Write in a manner that makes it look like it is not entirely generated by an LLM.
Write a professional, academically-oriented report (1,500–2,000 words) that:
Summarizes my specific technical accomplishments in designing and implementing the NER Agent. This should include:
Hybrid ML + rule-based NER pipeline design (spaCy transformers, regex patterns).
Integration with Qdrant vector DB for structured retrieval.
Agent orchestration with MCP connectors.
Testing & validation (accuracy, latency, injection handling).
Compares my contribution to typical peer work (showing that I went beyond the average by building reusable, production-style modules instead of simple academic demos).
Highlights Responsible AI practices: confidence scoring, explainability logs, bias mitigation, and secure entity handling.
Reflects on learning and growth:
Skills acquired (hybrid AI design, orchestration, explainable AI).
Challenges faced (entity ambiguity, imbalanced data).
How this aligns with industry use cases (banking, CTI SaaS).
Uses a scholarly tone appropriate for academic submission (structured, evidence-backed, and clearly referenced to AIC/Capstone learning outcomes).
Make the writing concise, impactful, and impressive to an academic examiner — emphasizing depth, clarity, and reflection over marketing fluff."
