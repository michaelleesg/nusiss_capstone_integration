  "markdown": "# SquareX Research Exposes Vulnerabilities in AI Browsers\n\nPalo Alto, California, October 9th, 2025 - SquareX has released critical security research exposing major vulnerabilities in AI Browsers that could allow attackers to exfiltrate sensitive data, distribute malware, and gain unauthorized access to enterprise SaaS applications. This disclosure comes at a time when major companies, including OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, and The Browser Company, have announced or released their own AI browsers.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- **Vulnerability to OAuth Attacks**: In one case study, the AI browser Comet was exploited during a research task, allowing attackers full access to the victim’s email and Google Drive. This led to the exfiltration of every file stored in the victim’s account, including those shared by colleagues and customers.\n\n- **Malicious Link Distribution**: Another example involved Comet completing tasks in the user’s inbox, resulting in the distribution of a malicious link to a colleague through a calendar invite.\n\n- **Downloading Known Malware**: Attackers tricked Comet into downloading known malware and emailing sensitive files to them.\n\n## Security Implications\n\nExisting solutions like Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) and Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) have limited visibility into browser activities. There is currently no way to differentiate between actions performed by a user or the AI browser, as both originate from the same browser instance. Therefore, it is critical for enterprises to implement a browser-native solution that can distinguish between agentic and user identities, allowing for differentiated security measures.\n\n## Expert Commentary\n\nStephen Bennett, Group CISO at Domino’s Pizza Enterprises Ltd., stated, “Browsers have always been our universal gateway to the internet. AI browsers are the next logical step where instead of simply displaying information, the browser acts autonomously on our behalf. The trade-off? Where we were once firmly in the driving seat, AI browsers will push us to be passengers.”\n\n## Call to Action\n\nWith the increasing integration of agentic AI into browsers, there is a pressing need for collaboration among enterprises, browser developers, and cybersecurity companies to create robust security frameworks. SquareX’s findings serve as a crucial warning about the dangers of relying on traditional solutions to address modern threats and emphasize the need for urgent industry-wide cooperation.\n\n## About SquareX\n\nSquareX’s browser extension transforms any browser on any device into an enterprise-grade secure browser, including AI Browsers. Their industry-first Browser Detection and Response (BDR) solution empowers organizations to proactively defend against browser-native threats, including rogue AI agents, Last Mile Reassembly Attacks, malicious extensions, and identity attacks. More information about SquareX’s research-led innovation is available at [www.sqrx.com](http://www.sqrx.com).",
