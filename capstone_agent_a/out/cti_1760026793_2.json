Since the emergence of cloud technology, organizations have been working to secure it to varying degrees of success. There are a few factors that make cloud security uniquely challenging:\nHigh level of reuse of cloud resources.\nComplexity of cloud-native technologies, like containers and serverless architectures.\nAn expanding attack surface rife with misconfigurations.\nAttackers are taking advantage. Our\n2025 Global Incident Response Report\n(IR report) highlights this critical challenge. Nearly a third of the incidents Unit 42 investigated in 2024 were cloud-related. In 21% of cases, threat actors adversely impacted cloud environments and assets. Public data exposures and excessive permissions gave attackers, like\nBling Libra\nand\nMuddled Libra\n, greater ability to cause damage.\nEven with an abundance of cloud security tools in the market, organizations still struggle to apply cybersecurity best practices, like least privilege, zero trust and even patch hygiene. However, organizations can work toward closing the cloud security gap:\nUnderstand the cloud’s shared responsibility model.\nAchieve full visibility.\nImprove identity and access management (IAM).\nCreate secure configurations.\nAutomate detection and response processes.\nUnderstanding the Shared Responsibility Model\nEvery major cloud service provider (CSP) follows a shared responsibility model. You secure your data, identities and configurations, while your provider secures the underlying hardware. The exact division of responsibility can depend on the type of service provided. If you create a virtual machine, you’re responsible for the infrastructure but not the physical hardware in the CSP’s data center. If you use the CSP’s managed services, the CSP will take greater responsibility for the digital infrastructure.\nDefenders should ensure clarity on which aspects of cloud security fall to their organization.\nVisibility Is the First Line of Defense\nThe cloud on its own isn’t extraordinarily complex. What is complex is the resource sprawl across multiple environments.\nFrontend services connect to backend services over internal load balancers or service meshes. You may have private link endpoints, transit gateways, VPN tunnels or direct connections to hybrid environments that you do not know about.\nA firewall rule or security group change may open unintended access. A dev team may deploy containers using base images with known vulnerabilities. Old storage buckets with outdated access controls may be left behind long after a project retires.\nOrganizations need the ability to zoom out and map connections to create a holistic, dynamic view.\nPrioritization Creates Efficiency\nJust because you can see it all doesn’t mean you can fix it all.\nContext is everything, and a single alert hardly ever tells the whole story. A login from an unexpected location may come from a traveling executive or from a malicious account takeover. A Critical CVE may exist on a nonexposed test system and therefore doesn’t matter. Meanwhile a Medium alert on a domain controller could pose a more significant business risk.\nAlert correlation and consolidation can unlock real-time, proactive defense.\nOrganizations should use AI and machine learning to assist with quickly gathering context, filtering noise and capturing the scope of a threat.\nIdentity Is the Perimeter\nOur IR Report found that threat actors often used valid cloud accounts. They used them to further particular goals:\nInitial access: 13% of cases\nPrivilege escalation: 8% of cases\nPersistence: 7% of cases\nDefense evasion: 7% of cases\nOverpermissioned identities remain a top risk.\nOrganizations should follow best practices for IAM. These are Unit 42 recommendations:\nStart with the principle of least privilege.\nAudit and rotate credentials regularly.\nUse cloud audit logs to detect lateral movement.\nAvoid long-term IAM access keys\n, as they can easily be exploited by attackers if the credentials are leaked.\nSecure Configurations Are Not Optional\nWhile CSPs provide various default security configurations, they need additional work to meet best practices. Common missteps in configurations include exposed cloud storage, unpatched container images and publicly accessible APIs.\nIf left unchanged, these missteps can turn into massive breaches, costing your business its data, revenue and reputation.\nCSP-specific tools can enforce baseline security standards, but few businesses are dealing with baseline attacks. Regularly scan and benchmark your security across frameworks like the Center for Internet Security (\nCIS\n) / Security Technical Implementation Guide (\nSTIG\n) for a comprehensive picture of the environment.\nAutomate Detection and Response\nPowered by automation, AI, as well as hacker toolkits, the speed of intrusion is now faster. In nearly 20% of Unit 42 investigations, data exfiltration took place within the first hour of compromise. Teams must become capable of responding at machine speed.\nThat’s tough to achieve in the cloud. Organizations operate a plethora of cloud-based SaaS tools, as well as multicloud environments. That presents a wide variety of log formats and APIs, and some third-party logs may be inaccessible. Identity misuse, like privilege escalation and lateral movement through API calls, is harder to spot than malware being deployed on a server. With DevOps teams spinning up and decommissioning resources, an incident may be indistinguishable from a misconfigured deployment without strong baselines.\nCloud Security Is a Continuous Discipline\nSecuring the business means securing the cloud. At Palo Alto Networks, we’ve designed our tools and services to provide exceptional defense that speaks to the highly dynamic realities of cloud environments.\nHere’s how Palo Alto Networks can help you\nstart securing your cloud\n:\nCortex Cloud®\noffers full coverage agentless visibility across every cloud layer – infrastructure, compute, code identity, data, AI. This enables security teams to understand what's actively running in their cloud without disrupting business operations or slowing down application development. Cortex Cloud integrates cloud posture capabilities, like cloud security posture management, AI security posture management, Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM), data security posture management and vulnerability management, into a single data platform that reduces risk noise and enables swift, scalable remediation.\nWhen integrated with a SOC platform, like Cortex XSIAM, Cortex Cloud brings cloud assets into the same unified visibility, control and response framework that protects everything else in your environment.\nFor a deep dive on the latest threat research and tips on how defenders can turn the table, download the full\n2025 Global Incident Response Report\n.\nFAQs for the Cloud Security Gap\nWhat makes cloud security uniquely challenging?\nCloud security is challenging due to the high level of reuse of cloud resources, the complexity of cloud-native technologies, like containers and serverless architectures, and an expanding attack surface rife with misconfigurations.\nHow are attackers exploiting cloud vulnerabilities?\nAttackers are taking advantage of vulnerabilities, with nearly a third of incidents in 2024 being cloud-related. They use public data exposures and excessive permissions to impact cloud environments and assets, as highlighted in the 2025 Global Incident Response Report. Threat actors often use valid cloud accounts for many reasons: initial access, privilege escalation, persistence, defense evasion.\nWhat steps can organizations take to close the cloud security gap?\nOrganizations can close the cloud security gap by understanding the cloud’s shared responsibility model to achieve full visibility across environments. They can also improve identity and access management (IAM) by following least privilege principles, creating secure configurations, and automating detection and response processes to match the speed of intrusions.\nRelated Blogs\nAI and Cybersecurity\n,\nAI Security\n,\nCybersecurity\n,\nData Security\n,\nIncident Response\n,\nReports\n,\nUnit 42\nThe Case for Multidomain Visibility\nPoints of View\n,\nReports\n,\nUnit 42\nSocial Engineering on the Rise — New Unit 42 Report\nAnnouncement\n,\nReports\n,\nUnit 42\nPalo Alto Networks Named a Leader in WW Incident Response Services\nAnnouncement\n,\nReports\n,\nUnit 42\n​​2025 Unit 42 Incident Response Report — Attacks Shift to Disruption\nCybersecurity\n,\nProducts and Services\n,\nReports\n,\nThreat Prevention\n,\nThreat Research\n,\nUnit 42\nTop Three Ways Organizations Were Unprepared for Cyberattacks in 2023\nAnnouncement\n,\nPoints of View\n,\nReports\n,\nUnit 42\nNavigating the Complex Threat Landscape — Key Takeaways for CISOs\nSubscribe to the Blog!\nSign up to receive must-read articles, Playbooks of the Week, new feature announcements, and more.\nSign up\nPlease enter a valid email.\nBy submitting this form, you agree to our\nTerms of Use\nand acknowledge our\nPrivacy Statement\n.
