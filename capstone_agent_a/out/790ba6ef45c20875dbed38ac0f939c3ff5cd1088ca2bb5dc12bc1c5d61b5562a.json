  "summary": "The FBI has issued a warning regarding two cyber criminal groups, UNC6040 and UNC6395, who are actively exploiting Salesforce platforms for data theft and extortion. UNC6040 uses social engineering tactics, particularly voice phishing, to gain access to Salesforce accounts, while UNC6395 exploits compromised OAuth tokens from third-party applications. Both groups have been observed exfiltrating sensitive data and subsequently extorting victims. Organizations are urged to implement robust security measures to mitigate these threats.",
