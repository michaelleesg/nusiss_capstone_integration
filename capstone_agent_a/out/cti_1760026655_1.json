  "markdown": "# Discord Data Breach: 70,000 ID Photos Exposed\n\n## Overview\nOn October 3, 2025, Discord confirmed a data breach affecting approximately 70,000 users who submitted government identification for age verification. The breach was attributed to a third-party vendor, not Discord's main systems.\n\n## Incident Details\n- **Date of Breach**: September 20, 2025\n- **Duration of Access**: 58 hours\n- **Method of Access**: Compromise of a support agent's account from an outsourced vendor.\n- **Affected Users**: Approximately 70,000 users globally.\n\n### Attack Claims\nThe attackers claimed to have stolen:\n- **Data Volume**: 1.6 TB\n- **Impacted Users**: 5.5 million unique users\n- **Exposed IDs**: Allegedly involved 521,000 age-verification tickets.\n\n## Discord's Response\nDiscord stated:\n- The breach was not on their systems but through a third-party service (Zendesk).\n- The attackers' claims of a larger data theft are inaccurate and part of an extortion attempt.\n- They have informed affected users and are collaborating with law enforcement and security experts.\n\n## Security Steps for Affected Users\nAffected users are advised to:\n- Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** on Discord and associated email accounts.\n- Remain vigilant against phishing attempts.\n- Monitor credit and financial reports for identity theft.\n\n### Data Exposed\nThe exposed data may include:\n- Real names\n- Usernames\n- Email addresses\n- Contact details\n- IP addresses\n- Partial payment information (last four digits of credit card)\n\nDiscord confirmed that no full credit card numbers, passwords, or authentication data were accessed.\n\n## Conclusion\nDiscord is prioritizing user data protection and has terminated its relationship with the compromised vendor. Users are encouraged to take immediate security measures to safeguard their information.",
  "mitre_analysis": {
    "attack_pattern": "The attack pattern indicates a sophisticated approach where attackers first compromised a support agent's account (T1078) to gain initial access. This led to significant data exfiltration (T1041) from a third-party vendor, resulting in the exposure of sensitive user data (T1486). Additionally, the context of phishing awareness (T1566.001) suggests that social engineering tactics were likely employed as part of the attack strategy.",
