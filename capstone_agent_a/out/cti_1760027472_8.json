  "markdown": "# Hackers Access SonicWall Cloud Firewall Backups, Spark Urgent Security Checks\n\n**Date:** Oct 09, 2025  \n**Author:** Ravie Lakshmanan  \n**Categories:** Cloud Security, Network Security\n\nSonicWall disclosed that an unauthorized party accessed firewall configuration backup files for all customers who have used the cloud backup service. The files contain encrypted credentials and configuration data; while encryption remains in place, possession of these files could increase the risk of targeted attacks.\n\nSonicWall is working to notify all partners and customers and has released tools to assist with device assessment and remediation. The company urges users to log in and check for their devices.\n\n## Incident Overview\n\nThe development follows a previous incident where SonicWall urged customers to perform a credential reset after their firewall configuration backup files were exposed in a security breach impacting MySonicWall accounts.\n\n### Impacted Devices\n\nThe list of impacted devices available on the MySonicWall portal has been assigned a priority level to help customers prioritize remediation efforts:\n\n- **Active – High Priority:** Devices with internet-facing services enabled\n- **Active – Lower Priority:** Devices without internet-facing services\n- **Inactive:** Devices that have not pinged home for 90 days\n\nThe latest post-mortem marks a shift from SonicWall's initial assessment, which claimed that the threat actors accessed backup firewall preference files stored in the cloud for less than 5% of its customers. While the credentials within those files were encrypted, they included \"information that could make it easier for attackers to potentially exploit the related firewall.\"\n\n## Recommendations for Users\n\nUsers are advised to follow these steps immediately:\n\n1. Log in to MySonicWall.com account and verify if cloud backups exist for registered firewalls.\n   - If fields are blank, there is no impact.\n   - If fields contain backup details, verify whether impacted serial numbers are listed in the account.\n   - If Serial Numbers are shown, users should follow the containment and remediation guidelines for the listed firewalls.\n\nSonicWall stated that in cases where customers have used the Cloud Backup feature but no Serial Numbers are shown or only some of the registered Serial Numbers are displayed, it will provide additional guidance in the coming days.",

    "attack_pattern": "The attack pattern indicates a breach of cloud security leading to unauthorized access to sensitive configuration files. The techniques identified reflect a coherent attack chain starting from initial access, through data operations, and culminating in credential access and impact mitigation efforts.
