  "markdown": "# Discord Confirms 70,000 Government IDs Exposed in Third-Party Breach\n\n**Posted on:** October 9, 2025  \n**Author:** Dissent\n\nDiscord is facing a significant extortion attempt following a breach of one of its third-party customer service providers, resulting in the exposure of sensitive user data, including government identification photos used for age verification. \n\n## Incident Overview\n\nThreat actors claim to have exfiltrated **1.5 terabytes** of sensitive information, including over **2.1 million** government-issued identification photos. However, Discord disputes these figures, stating that approximately **70,000 users** had their ID photos exposed during the incident on **September 20, 2025**. The breach did not directly target Discord’s infrastructure but compromised customer support systems managed by **Zendesk**, a third-party vendor.\n\n## Discord's Statement (Updated October 8, 2025)\n\n### TL;DR:\nDiscord discovered an incident where an unauthorized party compromised one of its third-party vendors. This was not a breach of Discord itself but rather a third-party service used for customer support. The incident impacted a limited number of users who had communicated with Discord's Customer Support or Trust & Safety teams.\n\n### Key Details:\n- **Impacted Users:** Approximately **70,000** users may have had government-ID photos exposed.\n- **Data Accessed:**\n  - Name, Discord username, email, and other contact details provided to Discord customer support.\n  - Limited billing information (payment type, last four digits of credit card, purchase history).\n  - IP addresses.\n  - Messages with customer service agents.\n  - Limited corporate data (training materials, internal presentations).\n  - A small number of government-ID images.\n\n### Data Not Involved:\n- Full credit card numbers or CCV codes.\n- Messages or activity on Discord beyond discussions with customer support.\n- Passwords or authentication data.\n\n## Response Actions\n\nDiscord has taken the following steps in response to the incident:\n- Revoked the customer support provider’s access to the ticketing system.\n- Launched an internal investigation.\n- Engaged a leading computer forensics firm to support investigation and remediation efforts.\n- Collaborated with law enforcement to investigate the attack.\n- Notified relevant data protection authorities.\n\n### Recommendations for Users\nImpacted users are advised to stay alert for suspicious communications. Discord has service agents available to answer questions and provide additional support.\n\n## Conclusion\nDiscord emphasizes its commitment to user privacy and security, stating that it is taking all appropriate steps to address the situation and prevent future incidents.",
