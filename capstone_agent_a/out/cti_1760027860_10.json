  "markdown": "# Your Shipment Notification is Now a Malware Dropper\n\n## Overview\nNew research from cybersecurity experts at Forcepoint X-Labs reveals a sharp rise in email attacks where criminals hide malicious software inside seemingly normal files. This report highlights a significant increase in campaigns using JavaScript attachments to bypass defenses.\n\n## The Lure\nForcepoint Security Researcher Mayur Sewani notes that attackers are cloaking their lures in everyday business communications. Malicious emails are designed to resemble legitimate requests, such as fake purchase orders, shipment notices, or quotes. Common subject lines include:\n- \"RE: Payment Swift MT103\"\n- \"DHL Shipment Notification\"\n\nThese emails are often localized to the recipientâ€™s language, targeting non-English speaking businesses.\n\n## Hiding in Plain Sight\nThe attack typically begins with a compressed archive file (ZIP, RAR, 7z, or TAR) containing a heavily obfuscated JavaScript file. Once opened, the script acts as a downloader, using legitimate Windows tools like PowerShell and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to execute commands without displaying a window.\n\n### Heavily Obfuscated JavaScript Attachment\nThe malware delivery chain employs steganography, concealing malicious code within a harmless-looking image file (e.g., PNG). The downloader script extracts and decodes Base64 data to reconstruct the final binary.\n\n## The Final Payloads\nThe final payloads are typically Remote Access Trojans (RATs) and information-stealing programs. Examples identified during the investigation include:\n- **DarkCloud**\n- **Remcos**\n- **Agent Tesla**\n- **Formbook**\n\nThese payloads initiate Command and Control (C2) communication to exfiltrate stolen credentials, banking information, and system data. The attacks utilize complex methods, such as process hollowing, where malicious code runs inside a trusted program (e.g., RegASM.exe) to evade detection.\n\n## Recommendations\nSewani advises organizations to combine advanced email filtering, endpoint protection, and user awareness to defend against these threats.",

    "attack_pattern": "The attack pattern demonstrates a sophisticated approach where attackers leverage social engineering through email to deliver obfuscated JavaScript payloads. The use of legitimate tools for execution and process hollowing for evasion indicates a well-planned strategy to bypass security measures. The inclusion of steganography further complicates detection efforts, while C2 communication highlights the goal of data exfiltration.",
