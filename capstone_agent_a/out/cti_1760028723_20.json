  "markdown": "# CISA Warns of Critical ICS Flaws in Delta Electronics DIAScreen, Rockwell Automation Modules\n\n**Date:** October 09, 2025\n\nThe U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published two ICS (industrial control system) advisories addressing hardware vulnerabilities found in Delta Electronics DIAScreen and Rockwell Automation products. CISA calls upon users and administrators to review newly released ICS advisories for technical details and mitigations.\n\n## Delta Electronics DIAScreen Vulnerabilities\n\nCISA warned that Delta Electronics’ DIAScreen software contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability affecting versions 1.6.0 and earlier. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to write data outside of the allocated memory buffer.\n\n### Vulnerabilities Identified:\n- **CVE-2025-59297**\n  - **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 6.6\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 6.8\n- **CVE-2025-59298**\n  - **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 6.6\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 6.8\n- **CVE-2025-59299**\n  - **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 6.6\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 6.8\n- **CVE-2025-59300**\n  - **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 6.6\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 6.8\n\nNatnael Samson, working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative, reported these vulnerabilities to CISA. Delta Electronics has released v1.6.1 of DIAScreen and recommends users install this update on all affected systems.\n\n## Rockwell Automation Vulnerabilities\n\nIn another advisory, CISA disclosed that Rockwell’s 1756-EN4TR and 1756-EN4TRXT equipment used in the global chemical and critical manufacturing sectors contained improper input validation and improper handling of exceptional conditions. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in an attacker causing a denial of service condition.\n\n### Vulnerabilities Identified:\n- **CVE-2025-8007**\n  - **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 6.5\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 7.1\n- **CVE-2025-8008**\n  - **CVSS v3.0 Base Score:** 6.5\n  - **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 7.1\n\nRockwell Automation recommends that users upgrade their devices to version 7.001 or later. The update is available for download on the company’s website.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nCISA recommends that users take defensive measures to reduce the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities:\n- Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems, ensuring they are not accessible from the internet.\n- Place control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.\n- Use more secure methods such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) for remote access, while ensuring VPNs are updated to the latest version.\n- Take appropriate precautions against social engineering attacks.\n- Conduct thorough impact analyses and risk assessments before deploying defensive measures.\n\nCISA also offers guidance on securing control systems through its ICS webpage, which includes recommended practices and downloadable resources such as \"Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies.\" Organizations are encouraged to adopt these cybersecurity strategies to proactively protect their ICS assets.",
