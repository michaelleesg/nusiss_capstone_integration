  "markdown": "# SonicWall: Firewall Configurations Stolen for All Cloud Backup Customers\n\n**By Bill Toulas**  \n**October 9, 2025**\n\nSonicWall has confirmed that all customers using the company's cloud backup service are affected by a security breach that occurred last month. The incident exposed firewall configuration backup files stored in certain MySonicWall accounts.\n\n## Incident Overview\n\nMySonicWall is an online customer portal for managing product access, licensing, registration, firmware updates, support cases, and cloud backups of firewall configurations (.EXP files). On September 17, SonicWall warned customers to reset their MySonicWall account credentials to protect their firewall configuration backup files from unauthorized access.\n\n## Essential Steps for Mitigation\n\nTo help administrators navigate the risk stemming from the breach, SonicWall provided essential steps for the reset procedure, which should cover all credentials, API keys, and user authentication tokens, VPN accounts, and services. The critical actions include:\n\n- Resetting and updating passwords of all local users\n- Resetting temporary access codes (TOTP) for local users\n- Updating passwords on LDAP, RADIUS, or TACACS+ servers\n- Updating the shared secret in all IPSec site-to-site and GroupVPN policies\n- Updating passwords for any L2TP/PPPoE/PPTP WAN interfaces\n- Resetting the Cloud Secure Edge (CSE) API key\n\nAdditionally, less critical actions include:\n\n- Updating AWS keys for logging and VPN integration\n- Resetting SNMPv3 user credentials\n- Updating passwords for WWAN connections\n\nSonicWall warned that access to the exposed firewall configuration files could significantly ease exploitation efforts for threat actors. The company published detailed remediation guidance to assist affected users.\n\n## Investigation Update\n\nSonicWall specified that roughly 5% of its firewall customers utilize its cloud backup service. An update published recently confirmed that the incident impacts all customers who used the cloud backup portal to store firewall configuration files. \n\nThe investigation, conducted in collaboration with leading incident response firm Mandiant, confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed firewall configuration backup files for all customers using SonicWall's cloud backup service. The exposed files contain AES-256-encrypted credentials and configuration data.\n\n## User Actions\n\nUsers can check if their devices are among the impacted ones by logging into MySonicWall and navigating to 'Product Management â†’ Issue List.' If any action items are pending review, users should follow the Essential Credential Reset steps, prioritizing active, internet-facing firewalls.\n\nAlthough SonicWall has stated that the investigation is complete, it is advisable for system administrators to continue monitoring MySonicWall alerts periodically for updated lists of affected devices.",
