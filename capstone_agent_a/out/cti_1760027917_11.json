  "markdown": "# LABScon25 Replay | Auto-Poking The Bear: Analytical Tradecraft In The AI Age\n\n**Date:** October 9, 2025\n\nIn this LABScon25 talk, Dreadnode’s Martin Wendiggensen and Brad Palm explore how AI is changing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and the research practices that support it. Analytical tradecraft and shared standards have transformed CTI from a niche discipline into a collaborative industry-wide research endeavor. Researchers and analysts now routinely build on each other’s work, creating a foundation of trust and shared methodology.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- The ecosystem is being disrupted as teams increasingly hand off data preparation, analysis, and entire workflows to AI assistants. \n- While these tools boost productivity, they introduce new costs and concerns over reliability and transparency.\n- The CTI community will need to adapt its research methodology and develop a new joint understanding of the promises, pitfalls, and probabilities inherent in AI-assisted work.\n\n## Case Study\n\nWendiggensen and Palm present a case study illustrating their approach. They created an LLM-driven agentic system to analyze Russian internet content leaked by Ukrainian cyber activists. The speakers detail the system’s architecture and demonstrate its performance across tasks from straightforward data collation to complex analytical pipelines used to track adversaries.\n\n### Technology Assessment\n\n- The presentation explains how to assess the technology’s strengths and limits.\n- It emphasizes the importance of communicating those judgments to peers and wider audiences to preserve both accountability and transparency.\n\nThis engaging talk lays the groundwork for discussions not only in threat intelligence but in any collaborative discipline seeking to navigate the challenges of integrating agentic systems into their data analysis and decision-making pipelines.\n\n## About the Authors\n\n- **Martin Wendiggensen**: AI Research Scientist at Dreadnode and PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins AIST. His research focuses on how AI is shifting the Cybersecurity Offensive-Defensive Balance.\n  \n- **Brad Palm**: COO at Dreadnode. Previously, he was a VP of Services and Technology for Pathfynder and the Managing Director of Software at Ascent, focusing on SOC automation and the integration of CTI in the delivery of managed services.",
